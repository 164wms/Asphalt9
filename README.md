## Detailed explanations of scripts
We have two scripts:
* The euro scripts can run 12rd level of EURO SHOWN in chapter 4 without stopping.
    * We use the first 6 cars (actually z4, XL, BMW and DS is enough) to run 12rd level of EURO SHOWN in chapter 4.You had better complete the whole EURO SHOWN season and your cars' rank cannot be too low to complete races.
    * You're able to modify which cars will be used and which order they will be used by editing "cars" in  the top of this scripts.
    * The number 1 means the car is at row 1 and column 1 in car select page, while the number 2 means row 2 and column 1, the number 3 means row 1 and column 2, and so on... We choose [1,2,3,4,5,6] as the default setting.At this case, car 1 which means Z4 will be used first, and XL will be the second...
    * This script finish a race in one and a half minute on average, which means **more than 90000 credits** and **more than 1500 reputation points** an hour.

    * This script will set brightness and media volume to 0.**DO NOT worry about it.** The brightness and media volume would be restored after you stop the script manually.

    * You had better max the first car to make sure be the winner.
    * Due to GL only makes tiny changes to "New Car Unleashed" series, you guys probably only need to  change some parameter to get this script work well for future usage.
